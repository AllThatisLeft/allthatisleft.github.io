    bio: I am a non-sectarian Marxist-Leninist from Belfast, Northern Ireland who hopes to encourage class-consciousness and political education among readers. Itâ€™s my hope that I can play a part in encouraging readers to develop their own ideological understanding and to apply this knowledge when the time arises. Agitating locally, encouraging others and passing the spirit onwards.
